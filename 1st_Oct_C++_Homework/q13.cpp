// 3. Write a program to print all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 1000. 

// An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the total number of digits. For example, 153 is a 3-digit Armstrong number because \(1^{3}+5^{3}+3^{3}=1+125+27=153\). This concept is also known as a narcissistic number.
